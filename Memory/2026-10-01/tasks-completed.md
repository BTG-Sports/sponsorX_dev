## GitHub Actions cut to once a day; deploys at 8 pm Manila

- **Why.** GitHub Actions stopped starting jobs on 2026-09-30 at 09:19 UTC: "recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased". CI ran on every push and every pull request — about 10 minutes a run, and 82, 56 and 41 runs on 28, 29 and 30 Sept — against 2,000 included minutes a month. The user can't pay for now and will wait for the monthly reset.
- **CI (`ci.yml`).** Now runs once a day at 12:00 UTC (8 pm Manila) on `main`, or by hand. It no longer runs on pushes or pull requests: not on working branches, not on `main_development`, not on `main`. A first `changed` job skips the heavy jobs when `release` already equals `main`. Estimated ~300 minutes a month.
- **Deploy (`deploy-daily.yml`, new).** Triggered when CI completes successfully on `main`. If both CI jobs passed on that commit, it force-moves the `release` branch to it. Railway, watching `release`, deploys `api` and `web` to staging and production. It never writes to `main` and needs no Railway key. That design was chosen because the Railway CLI login is "Not Authorized" to create project tokens, but can update deploy triggers.
- **Manual deploys are unchanged:** Railway's buttons, or `npm run deploy`.
- **Tracker.**
  - `tracker-notify.yml` is now "Tracker sheet sync": `notify --no-slack` updates the Google Sheet on every tracker change on `main` and posts nothing to Slack.
  - `tracker-digest.yml` now runs every day at 8 pm Manila (was weekdays at 9 pm), and the digest lists every task change since the previous evening ("What changed").
  - The tracker tests now pass at 19.
- **Railway, not done yet.** After this lands on `main`: create `release` at `main`, then point the four deploy triggers (staging and production × `api` and `web`) at `release`. Trigger IDs: staging 577b3a24…, fa327cb5…; production 831bd597…, c9ddcb18….
